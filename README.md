3. Introduction to the Dataset used:
The ChestX-ray14dataset, introduced by Wang et al. (2017), represents a significant milestone in medical imaging research. It contains 108,948 frontal-view chest X-ray images collected from 32,717 unique patients. These images are paired with labels for eight common thoracic diseases mined from radiological reports using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This dataset is designed for tasks such as multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization, making it a valuable resource for deep learning applications in healthcare.

4. Architectural Overview
3.1 ResNet
ResNet (Residual Network) addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a critical challenge in training deep networks. Introduced by He et al. (2016), its primary innovation is the use of residual connections.
Key Features:
    • Residual Blocks: Shortcut connections enable the network to learn residual mappings, ensuring efficient gradient flow.
    • Identity Mapping: Helps preserve information across layers.
    • Scalability: ResNet can support hundreds or thousands of layers due to its unique architecture.

3.2 DenseNet
DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks), proposed by Huang et al. (2017), establishes direct connections between every layer, promoting feature reuse.
Key Features:
    • Dense Connectivity: Each layer receives input from all preceding layers, ensuring enhanced feature propagation.
    • Parameter Efficiency: By reusing features, DenseNet achieves high efficiency with fewer parameters.
    • Transition Layers: 1x1 convolutions and pooling layers reduce dimensionality.

Growth Rate: DenseNet introduces a growth rate kk, which controls the width of the network by defining the number of output feature maps per layer.
3.3 Xception
Xception, introduced by Chollet (2017), extends the Inception architecture by leveraging depthwise separable convolutions, enabling efficient feature extraction.
Key Features:
    • Depthwise Separable Convolutions: Decouples spatial and channel-wise correlations for computational efficiency.
    • Residual Connections: Provides robust gradient flow.
    • Three Flows: Entry, middle, and exit flows for hierarchical feature extraction.
